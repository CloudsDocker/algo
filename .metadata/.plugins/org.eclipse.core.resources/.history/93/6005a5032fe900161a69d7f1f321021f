/**
 * Created by todzhang on 2017/2/2.
 * As a concrete illustration, weâ€™re going to build a set of test cases for a bounded buffer.
 * Listing 12.1 shows our BoundedBuffer implementation, using Semaphore to implement the
 * required bounding and blocking.
 BoundedBuffer implements a fixed-length array-based queue with blocking put and take methods
 controlled by a pair of counting semaphores. The availa- bleItems semaphore represents the number
 of elements that can be removed from the buffer, and is initially zero (since the buffer is initially empty).
 Similarly, availableSpaces represents how many items can be inserted into the buffer, and is initialized
 to the size of the buffer.
 A take operation first requires that a permit be obtained from available- Items. This succeeds immediately
 if the buffer is nonempty, and otherwise blocks until the buffer becomes nonempty. Once a permit is obtained,
 the next ele- ment from the buffer is removed and a permit is released to the availableSpaces semaphore.
 2 The put operation is defined conversely, so that on exit from ei- ther the put or take methods,
 the sum of the counts of both semaphores always equals the bound. (In practice, if you need a bounded buffer
 you should use ArrayBlockingQueue or LinkedBlockingQueue rather than rolling your own, but the technique
 used here illustrates how insertions and removals can be controlled in other data structures as well.)
